### Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Simplified)

This is a simple Python-based implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe where the user plays against the computer. The game follows these simplified rules:

- The computer always plays 'X' and goes first, starting in the center of the board.
- The user plays 'O', choosing their move by entering a number (1-9) representing an unoccupied square.
- The board is a 3x3 grid, with squares numbered row by row (1-9).
- The game checks after each turn for a win, loss, or tie.
- The computer randomly selects its moves after the first.
  
This project focuses on game mechanics and does not implement advanced AI for computer moves. A great beginner project to understand basic game logic and interaction in Python!
